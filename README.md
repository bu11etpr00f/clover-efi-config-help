Archiving this Repository. I have moved away from using Clover to using OpenCore. If you are still using Clover, and would like to convert to OpenCore, please see the following Guides:

This is a work in progress. I will remove this line from the README after I have completed all the edits I have pending.

I am creating these definitions in plist format in order to conform to the existing layout in Clover's config.plist file, and also so it is easily readable / expandable in Xcode.
